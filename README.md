# What is This?
PUM (Percentage Uniform Mark) is the value assigned to your CAIE grade.<br>
This value is out of 100 but isn't a true representation of the amount of marks you've received.<br>
This calculator aims to solve the issue. Simply enter your PUM mark and enter the relevant data to get your mark.<br>
NOTE: my calculator has thus far been accurate to &plusmn;1 raw mark. If you find any issues, please let me know.
