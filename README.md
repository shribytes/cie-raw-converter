### What is This?

PUM (Percentage Uniform Mark) is the value assigned to your CAIE report. This value is out of 100 but isn't a true representation of the number of marks you've received. This calculator aims to solve that issue. Simply enter your PUM mark and the relevant data to get your mark.
**NOTE:** My calculator has thus far been accurate to ±1 raw mark. If you find any issues, please let me know.

### Where can I get my Subject Thresholds From?

Grade threshold tables for IGCSE can be found at:  
https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-upper-secondary/cambridge-igcse/grade-threshold-tables/

Grade threshold tables for International AS and A Level can be found at:  
https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-advanced/cambridge-international-as-and-a-levels/grade-threshold-tables/

If you are manually inputting the thresholds, navigating to your subject then scroll to the final table of the file. Use the "Option" or "Combination of Components" column of the second table to figure out which examinations you have taken. Input the corresponding values into the site along with any other values required.

### How is my Raw Mark Calculated?

Firstly, we need to understand that Grade Threshold Tables tell us the minimum mark required for a certain grade. Instead of working towards your raw mark, we need to figure out how PUM (Percentage Uniform Mark) is calculated.

The example below shows how to convert a raw mark into PUM:
Let's assume the examination is out of 250 marks, and the thresholds are:
- A*: 220
- A: 200
- B: 170
- C: 140
- D: 130

If you received 205 marks, you know your mark is between the A requirement and the A* requirement (as your mark is between 200 and 220). Therefore, your PUM is between 80 and 90.
To calculate the exact PUM value, we need to consider how many marks you are over the threshold. In this case, 205 is 5 marks over the requirement for an A. We also need to know the total marks between the thresholds: 220 - 200 = 20.
If we were to represent the amount you are over the threshold as a fraction, it would be 1/4 (since 5/20 = 1/4). Now, we want to convert your remaining marks into PUM. We know the distance between two thresholds is 10 points. Therefore, 1/4 * 10 = 2.5.
Hence, your PUM value is 80 + 2.5 = 82.5, which will be rounded to the nearest integer, 83.
Reversing this process converts your PUM back into its raw mark.
